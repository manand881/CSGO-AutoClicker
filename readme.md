# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive AutoClicker / CSGO AutoClicker

This small project of mine is just for giggles. I admit that I'm bad at playing this game. I'm learning Python so I thought "What if i wrote a program that empties 10 rounds in a single click? that'll be nice!", so here it is.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip3 install keyboard
pip3 install mouse
pip3 install PyAutoGUI
```

If you're a Windows user, you can choose to run the [requirements.bat](https://github.com/manand881/CSGO-AutoClicker/blob/master/requirements.bat) file to auto install the dependencies for you.
